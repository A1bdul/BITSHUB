Xiaomi Mi10 Ultra
Xiaomi celebrating 10 years of making cheap and remarkable smartphones released the Mi 10 Ultra.
The phone has a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 1080 x 2400 resolution, HDR10+, 10-bit color and a standard fast 120Hz refresh rate.
The Mi 20 Ultra is available in 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, 8GB / 256GB, 12GB / 256GB and 16GB / 512GB with it's pricing ranging from ¥5,299 to ¥6,999 which is roughly $760-$1,000 if converted.
It runs MIUI 12 and Android 10 when it was released in August but has it's bloatware problems and ads in display which can be disabled. It has a Snapdragon 865 chipset, which isn't quite the best available so far on an android phone. It also has a dual speakers set system.A good 4500Amh battery with a crazy super  120W fast charging rating, it can get a full battery in under 25 mins because it's battery is split into two cells of 2,250 mAh connected in series , and a fast 50W of wireless charging.
It also currently has the best camera set in the world with it's camera reaching a 120X zoom, more than the 100x on the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra,a 5X optical zoom. The main camera is only 48MP, 20MP ultra-wide and 12MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom portrait cameras.It has a 20MP ultrawide snapper with 13mm focal length and a second 12MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. The camera are so tall it's takes almost half of the height of the phone which can cause inconvenience when gaming .
The only problem is that there's not a global release yet except you ship from china.

Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
On February 20, 2020, Samsung announced the Samsung Galaxy 20 series, Samsung Galaxy S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra.
The Galaxy S20 Ultra was released in the US on March 6th.The phone is the biggest in the series with a 6.9 inches dynamic AMOLED  screen with resolution of up to 1440 x 3200 weighing up to 222 grams.
It's also with a 120Hz refresh rate and super sensitive touch sensor,Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 but on seven-nanometer, 64-bit octa-core chip.
It has 5000Amh battery with 45W fast charging, 100% in 74mins, 15W wireless charging and 9W of reverse charging (charging another phone).
The phone is not waterproof and also without 5G but Samsung says the Galaxy S20 phones are all 5G-ready, whenever the wireless tech happens to roll out more broadly.
The camera made the first record of 100X zoom but  it’s clear that anything beyond 10X suffers noticeable degradation in quality. It has three lenses (including a 108-megapixel wide), a flash, and a time-of-flight sensor for detecting distance. It also
40-megapixel selfie camera, this lenses are impossibly tiny pinholes on the front display of the phone.
It's pricing is $1399.99 in the US



Huawei Mate 40 pro
With Huawei  ongoing restrictions imposed by the US government, Huawei's phones can't use any Google services, including Gmail, Maps and Chrome and, most importantly of all, the Google Play store and then insisting that the world doesn't end with this one escalating trade dispute, Huawei announced in late October the Huawei Mate 40 pro.
The phone has a  6.76-inch OLED with 1344x2772px resolution,460ppi,HDR10 and a 90Hz refresh rating.
It has nice design of Glass front and aluminum frame, it has IP698 which means it is also waterproof with a maximum of 6m depth for 30 minutes like the Iphone 12 pro models, with a new Kirin 9000 chipset, the first 5nm SoC for Android also similar to that of the iphone 12 pro models.
It is powered by a 4400 Amh battery, with 66W fast USB charging and 50W wirelessly with also fast reverse charging
It has a proper tri-set of rear camera with a 50MP main unit and a 5x periscope tele, both coming straight from the P40 Pro, and a new 20MP ultra-wide, not the best for pictures but it seems Huawei made the camera for better videos with excellent stabilization to capture smooth footage but HDR mode in video is heavy-handed and a bad software processing.
It has a Ultra wide angle: 13 MP, f/2.4, 18mm; Depth: IR TOF 3D; HDR front camera.
It has  super stereo speakers with infrared face recognition and on display fingerprint for security.
The Mate 40 Pro costs £1099.99 in the UK, which is roughly $1,430  in the US

It has 5G connectivity  but no headphone jack which I think I will want on a gaming phone.
The phone has a powerful 5000Amh with a super fast 90W fast charging, best at the time in July charging the phone to full battery in just 30 mins. It has a weird two usb post to charge the phone from two side.

The front camera is 24 MP which pops up from the top of the phone and it has HDR, an LED flash, and 4K@30fps videos, great for a gaming phone.
